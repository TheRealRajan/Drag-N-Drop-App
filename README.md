# Drag-N-Drop-App
A drag and drop app utilizing the HTML Drag and Drop API using JavaScript event handling.
<br><br>
Various drags events are listened to using JavaScript and classes are added and removed on the boxes based on the current event to visualize the events that have occured.<br><br>
When you click and hold on the image in the first box, you can drag it to another box that is empty and as soon as you leave the mouse button it the image will now fill in the empty box.<br><br>
